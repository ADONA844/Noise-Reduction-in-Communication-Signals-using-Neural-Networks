This project focuses on designing a Neural Network (NN) that generates a noise-reduced version of an input communication signal and evaluates the systemâ€™s efficiency.
The objective is to take a noisy signal, process it using the trained neural network, and output a cleaner signal that preserves the original information while minimizing noise.


**Project Goals**
1.Develop a neural network model for noise reduction in communication signals.
2.Input: Noisy signal.
3.Output: Noise-reduced signal.
4.Evaluate the efficiency of the system using appropriate signal quality metrics.
